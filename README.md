## UNDER PROGRESS

# Taken
Takeover AWS ips and have a working POC for Subdomain Takeover.
Idea is simple 
- Get subdomains.
- Do reverse lookups to only save AWS ips.
- Restart EC2 instance every min. and public ip gets rotated on each restart. Match it with your existing list of subdomain ips and you have a subdomain takeover. 
- Notify via email.

## Pre-requisites
- AWS Account
- Knowledge of Linux and Bash script

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- `Bash`

## Features
- Gather subdomains and do reverse lookup to only target AWS ips.
- Rotate IPs by restarting ec2 instance until it matches one of the ips in the list. 
- On a match that IP/host is added in a whitelist file, so it doesn't gets rotated again and send an email notification.


## Detailed steps to use
1) Create one instance t2.medium (attack machine), free of cost 24*365.
2) Create 5-10 instances (higher the no. better chances but more the charges around $50/month for 10 machines) in one or more region, takes 5min.s, have SG Group opened to only your public ip.
3) Create AWS API keys to stop/start instances.
4) SSH to your attack machine.
5) Install email notification utility SSMTP.
6) Install subfinder and sublist3r.py tools for collecting subdomains. (Or any other tools you want but that would require you adding it in the script) 
7) Clone this repo, CD into the directory and open a screen session. export AWS credentials in that session.
8) Run the fetch subdomain script which uses subfinder and sublist3r.py, You can add more tools to it. This shall generate a list of all the subdomains for
one or more domains in the format "subdomain:IP" in each line. 
9) Run the takeover script in a screen session in multiple session for each region. <br/>
`Reasoning` - Each Region in AWS has associated different IP subnets. To target companies sitting in 
US, there are high chances they are running in any of US regions, but may also have assets in other regions like Ireland, Frankfurt etc. So instead of running 
10 assets in one region, try running 5 assets in the region company HQ is based and other 5 in different regions.

`Took over a subdomain what next` - 
SSH into that host, create a simple HTML file and start a python server and you have a running POC.
(I plan on automating this as well in next release)

## Running at Bulk
I scraped through all the public programs at HackerOne and Bugcrowd and top 500 SaaS Forbes/SaaS companies, collected their subdomains and started hitting.
Within 24 hours i was able to take over 10 subdomains. 
Instances running total 10 in 3 different regions.
Success rate depends highly upon no. of instances running. 
Since with the script you change around 3600 ips in 24 hours, that would make it around 36000 IPs with 10 instances in 24hours. 

## Installation
`export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
   The access key for your AWS account.` <br/>
`export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
   The secret access key for your AWS account.`<br/>
